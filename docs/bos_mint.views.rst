to a server sided execution of the associated python function and the html answer.

following in the address bar:

.. code-block:: python

    http://localhost:5000/foo

Most of the view function are pretty self explanatory and they do exactly \
what the function says. For an explanation what accounts, sports, \
eventgroups, etc. are take a look at the `Peerplays documentation \
<https://python-peerplays.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
